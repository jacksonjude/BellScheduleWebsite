        In order to use the User Schedule feature of the app, the user must create a User ID of their choosing and fill in their appropriate course schedule. This information is NOT distributed or sold, but can be accessed given the user's chosen User ID via the public CloudKit database for ease of access across multiple devices. The app will alert the user if the chosen User ID is already in use upon selection.
